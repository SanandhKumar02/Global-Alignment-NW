# Needleman–Wunsch Algorithm

### The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman–Wunsch algorithm</a> is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970.

### This is an interactive example of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (used for Global Alignment). The purpose is to visually illustrate how the algorithm works and how the alignment matrix is constructed.
